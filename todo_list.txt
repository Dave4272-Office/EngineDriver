1. get single activity with multiple, similar "listview" fragments working at OS 3.0, and understand how fragment width works.
2. add application state variables, starting with fragment list  Note: I plan to only use get/set for access to these, to provide for read-time checks.
3. add 3rd-party, back-level support for ActionBar.  Not sure I want to go all the way back to 1.6, but I'd at least like to be able to run this on my Nook and my wife's old phone.
4. add webviewFragment, with hard-coded url, and begin to understand how to handle the loading and running of differing fragments.  also understand webview fling vs. fragment fling
5. set up webviewFragments for About, Turnout and Routes (using the JMRIMobile pages)  url still hard-coded
6. add settings icon to each fragment, (dropping hard-coded urls) and deal with persistent storage.  also add mechanism to add new fragments and delete unneeded ones.  fragment list+settings should be restored on app start.
7. add Connect fragment, and initial socket reader/writer.  (re)position to Connect when no connection, Determine if Application object should "own" these async tasks, vs. fragment or activity.  Determine if handler is still the best way to communicate with them.
8. add jmdns listeners, updating discovered list in Connect fragment.  
9. add throttle fragment (hard-coded address), get communication working
10. add address/roster selection/entry dialog (determine if activity or fragment or popup dialog, or whatever)
11. add background roster details retrieval (maybe using json server?)
12. determine if various throttle "flavors" are settings for a single fragment type, or multiple fragment types.
13. add additional throttle flavors
14. replace Turnout and Route webviewFragments with listFragments,
