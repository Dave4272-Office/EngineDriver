Todo list:
  to be used for items which I plan to do, but am intentionally skipping for now.
  most of these are items "inside" a fragment, as I'm focusing on the cross-fragment issues first

All:
  Replace strings with constants
ConnectFragment:
  include last message in status line (or click to show it in a dialog?)
  color-code status line (red for no connection, green for connected, etc.)
  include the discovered host name in the recent list, instead of just the ip
  add most recently used at top of list, not bottom
  remove leftover formatting from ED, replace with new look
  if no discovered servers, show "No Items" label
  new function, long-press to select the auto-connect address?  or always auto-connect to first?
WebSocketRunnable:
  use heartbeat to kill "hung" connections (such as attempting to connect to the WiThrottle port)
MainActivity:
  "stop all" button in header, including landscape, sends stop to all attached locos
  Show the title in landscape mode
  reduce padding, etc. to avoid wide tabs
  check for About tab before showing option in menu (or add it when requested?)
  determine how to calculate width for "wide" screens, such as pads
  use prefs for default tab for portrait and landscape
JmDNS listener:
  use native Android listeners instead of JmDNS on supported devices
TurnoutsFragment:
  deal with showing/not showing based on userName
  manual entry of turnout by name and/or number
  remembered position is not cleared if servers switched while active
  don't request turnout list or set up listeners if no turnout frag in use

RoutesFragment:
  clone from TurnoutsFragment
WebViewFragment:
  prefs for initial zoom level, width, url
RemoveTabDialogFragment:
  for throttlefrags, release and remove any attached throttles
AddTabDialogFragment:
  add thumbnail images, especially helpful for throttle layouts
Throttle:
  handle repeat on inc/dec speed buttons
  fix spacing issue on 2-line-text buttons
  fix swipe over buttons
  fix spacing after rotation (going to single column now)
VerticalThrottle:
  use single fwd/rev button?
SelectLoco:
  manual entry
  recently used
  sort
  separate dialogs?
