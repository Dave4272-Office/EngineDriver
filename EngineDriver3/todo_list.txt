Todo list, to be used for items which I plan to do, but am intentionally skipping for now.
ConnectFragment:
  manual entry of address and port
  include last message in status line
  color-code status line (red for no connection, green for connected, etc.)
WebSocketRunnable:
  use heartbeat to kill "hung" connections (such as attempting to connect to the WiThrottle port)
MainActivity:
  notification icon when backgrounded
  Make the tabs not pile up in landscape mode
JmDNS listener:
  use native Android listeners instead of JmDNS where supported
  filter out/don't show (somehow) broadcasts which are not from a JMRI server
