Todo list, to be used for items which I plan to do, but am intentionally skipping for now.
ConnectFragment:
  manual entry of address and port
  include last message in status line
  color-code status line (red for no connection, green for connected, etc.)
  include the discovered host name in the recent list, instead of just the ip
  remove leftover formatting from ED, replace with new look
  if no discovered servers, show "No Items" label
WebSocketRunnable:
  use heartbeat to kill "hung" connections (such as attempting to connect to the WiThrottle port)
  don't show error message when connection is intentionally closed
MainActivity:
  notification icon when backgrounded
  Make the tabs not pile up in landscape mode
JmDNS listener:
  use native Android listeners instead of JmDNS on supported devices
  don't show (somehow) broadcasts which are not from a JMRI server
TurnoutsFragment:
  show state descriptions instead of values
