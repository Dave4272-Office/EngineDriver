Todo list, to be used for items which I plan to do, but am intentionally skipping for now.
All:
  Replace strings with constants
ConnectFragment:
  manual entry of address and port
  include last message in status line (or click to show it in a dialog?)
  color-code status line (red for no connection, green for connected, etc.)
  include the discovered host name in the recent list, instead of just the ip
  add most recently used at top of list, not bottom
  remove leftover formatting from ED, replace with new look
  if no discovered servers, show "No Items" label
  new function, long-press to select the auto-connect address?  or always auto-connect to first?
WebSocketRunnable:
  use heartbeat to kill "hung" connections (such as attempting to connect to the WiThrottle port)
  don't show error message when connection is intentionally closed
MainActivity:
  notification icon when backgrounded
  Show the title in landscape mode
  reduce padding, etc. to avoid wide tabs
  check for About tab before showing option in menu (or add it when needed?)
JmDNS listener:
  use native Android listeners instead of JmDNS on supported devices
TurnoutsFragment:
  deal with showing/not showing based on userName
  manual entry of turnout by name and/or number
  remembered position is not cleared if servers switched while active
  don't request turnout list or set up listeners if no turnout frag in use
RoutesFragment:
  clone from TurnoutsFragment
WebViewFragment:
  prefs for initial zoom level, width, url
RemoveTabDialogFragment:
AddTabDialogFragment:
  add thumbnail images, especially helpful for throttle layouts
Throttle:
  handle repeat on inc/dec speed buttons
  add function buttons, arrayed based on available space in the scroll widget
VerticalThrottle:
